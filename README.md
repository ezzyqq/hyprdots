### üö® Issues
#### Installation script
The installation script works **ONLY on Arch-like Distributions (like Artix, EndeavourOS, Manjaro)**

#### Waybar
If your laptop has a battery, you'll need to edit the waybar configuration and at `"custom/separator", "battery", `line, remove the '\*/' and '\/*'
